This website holds a secret...

An Easter egg is an intentional inside joke, hidden message, or feature in an interactive work such as a computer program, video game or DVD menu screen. The name has been said to evoke the idea of a traditional Easter egg hunt.

I decided to add an easter egg to this website.

The secret is - If you load any page and type "1up", you may hear a very familiar sound.
